	abstract = {Consciousness is a central issue in cognitive neuroscience. To explain the relationship between consciousness and its neural correlates, various theories have been proposed. We still lack a formal framework that can address the nature of the relationship between consciousness and its physical substrates though. Here, we provide a novel mathematical framework of Category Theory (CT), in which we can define and study the {\textquotedblleft}sameness{\textquotedblright} between {\textquotedblleft}different{\textquotedblright} domains of phenomena such as consciousness and its neural substrates. CT was designed and developed to deal with the {\textquotedblleft}relationships{\textquotedblright} between various domains of phenomena. We introduce three concepts of CT including (i) category; (ii) inclusion functor and expansion functor; and (iii) natural transformation between the functors. Each of these mathematical concepts is related to specific features in the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC). In this novel framework, we will examine two of the major theories of consciousness: integrated information theory (IIT) of consciousness and temporo-spatial theory of consciousness (TTC). These theories concern the structural relationships among structures of physical substrates and subjective experiences. The three CT-based concepts, introduced in this paper, unravel some basic issues in our search for the NCC; while addressing the same questions, we show that IIT and TTC provide different albeit complementary answers. Importantly, our account suggests that we need to go beyond a traditional concept of NCC including both content-specific and full NCC. We need to shift our focus from the relationship between {\textquotedblleft}one{\textquotedblright} neuronal and {\textquotedblleft}one{\textquotedblright} phenomenal state to the relationship between a structure of neural states and a structure of phenomenal states. We conclude that CT unravels and highlights basic questions about the NCC in general which needs to be met and addressed by any future neuroscientific theory of consciousness.Author summary Neuroscience has made considerable progress in uncovering the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC). At the same time, recent studies demonstrated the complexity of the neuronal mechanisms underlying consciousness. To make further progress in the neuroscience of consciousness, we need proper mathematical formalization of the neuronal mechanisms potentially underlying consciousness. Providing a first tentative attempt, our paper addresses both by (i) pointing out the specific problems of and proposing a new approach to go beyond the traditional approach of the neural correlates of consciousness, and (ii) by recruiting a recently popular mathematical formalization, category theory (CT). With CT, we provide mathematical formalization of the broader neural correlates of consciousness by its application to two of the major theories, integrated information theory (IIT) and temporo-spatial theory of consciousness (TTC). Together, our CT-based mathematical formalization of the neural correlates of consciousness including its specification in the terms of IIT and TTC allows to go beyond the current concept of NCC in both mathematical and neural terms.},

                  conscious experiences can be quantified through the
                  perceived similarity. Previously, we proposed that
                  by defining similarity relationships as arrows and
                  conscious experiences as objects, we can define a
                  category of qualia in the context of category
                  theory. However, the example qualia categories we
                  proposed were highly idealized and limited to cases
                  where perceived similarity is binary: either present
                  or absent without any gradation. Here, we introduce
                  enriched category theory to address the graded
                  levels of similarity that arises in many instances
                  of qualia. Enriched categories generalize the
                  concept of a relation between objects as a directed
                  arrow (or morphism) in ordinary category theory to a
                  more flexible notion, such as a measure of distance.
                  As an alternative relation, here we propose a graded
                  measure of perceived dissimilarity between the two
                  objects. We claim that enriched categories
                  accommodate various types of conscious experiences.
                  An important consequence of this claim is the
                  application of the Yoneda lemma in enriched
                  category; we can characterize a quale through a
                  collection of relationships between the quale and
                  the other qualia up to an (enriched) isomorphism.},
