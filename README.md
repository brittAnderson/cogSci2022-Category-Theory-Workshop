# cogSci2022-Category-Theory-Workshop
Notes and Materials from the Category Theory Workshop at the 2022 meeting of the Cognitive Science Society

In addition to sharing some of the presentations in the presentation subfolder we hope that we can expand the list of useful articles in the bibliography and add annotations to them. The intention is to guide cognitive scientists interested in category theory to begin exploring its details and applications. If you know how to use git, consider a pull request to add your comments and references. If you do not, just click on issues and put the link to your reference and your ideas in there and we will get it added to the bibliography.

We are open to other types of contributions too. Just make an issue or send an email. 

Basically, the goal of this repo is to be a one stop shop for Cognitive Scientists wanting to get started with applying category theory or simply looking for a place to learn more. Please consider contributing your experiences and recommendations.
